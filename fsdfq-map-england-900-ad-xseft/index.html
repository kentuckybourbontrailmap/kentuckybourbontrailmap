<p>History is a fascinating subject that helps us understand the past and how it shapes our present. In this article, we&#8217;ll take a journey through time and explore England in the year 900 AD. It was a time of great change, with the Vikings raiding and settling in England, and the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms fighting for power.</p>
<h2>The Kingdoms of England</h2>
<p>England in 900 AD was divided into several kingdoms, including Wessex, Mercia, Northumbria, East Anglia, and Kent. These kingdoms were ruled by different kings who were constantly vying for power and territory. </p>
<p>The most powerful of these kingdoms was Wessex, whose king, Alfred the Great, had successfully defended his kingdom against the Viking invaders. He was a wise and just ruler who had introduced many reforms, including the establishment of a standing army and the promotion of education.</p>
<h3>The Viking Invasions</h3>
<p>The Vikings were a seafaring people from Scandinavia who had been raiding the coasts of England for several decades. By 900 AD, they had established settlements in many parts of England, including York, which they called Jorvik.</p>
<p>The Viking invasions had a profound impact on England. They brought with them a new culture and language, and many of the place names in England today have their roots in the Viking language. The Vikings also introduced new technologies, such as shipbuilding and metalworking.</p>
<h2>The Church and Religion</h2>
<p>Religion played an important role in England in 900 AD. The country was predominantly Christian, and the Church was a powerful institution that wielded significant influence. The Archbishop of Canterbury was the most important religious figure in England, and he was responsible for overseeing the affairs of the Church.</p>
<p>The Church was responsible for many of the advances in education and learning during this period. Monasteries were centers of learning where books were copied and preserved. Many of the surviving manuscripts from this period were produced in monasteries.</p>
<h3>The Role of Women</h3>
<p>Women played an important role in Anglo-Saxon society, although their status varied depending on their social class. Women in the upper classes had more rights and freedoms than those in the lower classes. They could own property, run businesses, and even become queens.</p>
