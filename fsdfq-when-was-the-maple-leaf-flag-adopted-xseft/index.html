<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Canadian flag, also known as the maple leaf flag, is a symbol of Canada&#8217;s identity and unity. It is a red and white flag with a single, stylized, 11-pointed red maple leaf in the center. The design is simple, yet powerful, and has become a recognizable symbol of Canada around the world. But when was the maple leaf flag adopted? In this article, we&#8217;ll explore the history behind Canada&#8217;s national flag.</p>
<h2>The Old Flag</h2>
<p>Prior to the adoption of the maple leaf flag, Canada used the Red Ensign as its national flag. This flag featured the Union Jack in the upper left corner, with a shield in the center containing the coat of arms of the four founding provinces of Canada. While the Red Ensign was a symbol of Canadian identity, it was also a reminder of Canada&#8217;s colonial past and its ties to Great Britain.</p>
<h2>The Search for a New Flag</h2>
<p>In the 1960s, the Canadian government began a search for a new national flag. A committee was formed to review designs and make recommendations. The committee received thousands of submissions, but ultimately chose a design featuring a red and white flag with a single, stylized maple leaf in the center.</p>
<h2>The Adoption of the Maple Leaf Flag</h2>
<p>The new flag design was officially adopted on February 15, 1965. The adoption of the maple leaf flag was not without controversy, however. Some Canadians felt that the flag should have featured the Union Jack, as a nod to Canada&#8217;s ties to Great Britain. Others felt that the maple leaf design was too simplistic and lacked meaning.</p>
<h2>The Meaning of the Maple Leaf</h2>
<p>Despite the initial criticism, the maple leaf flag has become a powerful symbol of Canadian identity. The maple leaf is a symbol of Canada&#8217;s natural beauty, as well as its cultural and linguistic diversity.
